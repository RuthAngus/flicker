\subsection{Calibration Data}

For our calibration of \rhostar-$F_8$, we used a sample of Kepler stars with
both asteroseismic and flicker measurements available. \citet{chaplin:2014}
report asteroseismic \rhostar\ estimates (and the associated uncertainties) for
518 Kepler stars. The authors report three different sets of results, depending
on the choice of \Teff\ and \FeH, and in this work we elected to use values
reported in their Table 6 over Table 5, and Table 5 over Table 4. We
additionally used the 71 additional planet hosting stars with asteroseismology
reported in \citet{huber:2013} but not reported in \citet{chaplin:2014}. Values
for flicker and range were taken from \citet{kipping:2014}, based upon the
methods described in \citet{bastien:2013}. Following \citet{kipping:2014} and
for reasons described there-in, we only include targets in our calibration for
which:

\begin{itemize}
\item[{\tiny$\blacksquare$}] Range (defined in \citealt{bastien:2013})
$<1$\,ppt
\item[{\tiny$\blacksquare$}] $4500<T_{\mathrm{eff}}<6500$\,K
\item[{\tiny$\blacksquare$}] $K_P<14$
\item[{\tiny$\blacksquare$}] $1.2 < \log_{10}$($F_8$\,[ppm])$< 2.2$
\end{itemize}

We use the same sample for our calibration of \logg, except that we exclude the
\citet{huber:2013} data, since these authors do not provide estimates of
\logg\footnote{Whilst we could compute \logg\ ourselves from the reported
masses and radii, this could only be done under the incorrect assumption of
zero covariance between $M_{\star}$ and $R_{\star}$.}

\subsection{Hierarchical Bayesian Model}

We model the stochastic relationship between $F_8$, \logg\ and \rhostar,
accounting for the fact that there exists some intrinsic scatter in
the dependent variable, and including the heteroskedastic uncertainties on both
the dependent and independent variables.
There are two excellent reasons for modelling the relation stochastically;
firstly, if the intrinsic scatter is ignored and the relation between
variables is assumed to be deterministic, those data points with smaller
measurement uncertainties may have an unrepresentative greater weighting
during the fitting process.
Secondly, we are interested in producing probability distributions over stellar
densities and surface gravities, as opposed to point estimates, and propagating
these probability distributions through to subsequent analyses.
Several recent studies have required posterior Probability Distribution
Function (PDF) samples, in order to conduct their (hierarchical)
analyses \citep[e.g.][]{rogers:2015, foreman-mackey:2014, angus:2015}.

Including observational uncertainties on the independent variable within our
analysis is also important, because ordinary least squares regression methods
performed on data with two-dimensional uncertainties will result in a slope
that is biased towards zero
(e.g., Fuller 1987; Akritas \& Bershady 1996; Fox 1997).
For a demonstration of the effects of neglecting intrinsic scatter and
two-dimensional uncertainties, see Kelly (2007).

The two models describing the relationship between $F_8$, \logg and \rhostar
density can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\log_{10}(\rho_\star) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = \alpha + \beta
	\log_{10}(F_8), \sigma = \sigma_{\rho}),
\end{equation}
\label{eq:rho}
and
\begin{equation}
	\log_{10}(g) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = \gamma + \delta \log_{10}(F_8),
	\sigma = \sigma_g)
\end{equation}
\label{eq:logg}
The free parameters of the two models are $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\sigma_{\rho}$,
$\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\sigma_g$.
These relationships can be described as Gaussian distributions with means
given by the equation of a straight line, and standard deviations which
describe the intrinsic scatter about the mean.

In order to account for the two-dimensional observational uncertainties in
this data set, we marginalize over the latent, `true' values of $F_8$,
\rhostar and \logg using the importance sampling method of
\citep{hogg:2010}\footnote{Note that while the pseudo-marginal MCMC method of
\citep{andrieu:2009} provides a truly unbiased estimate of the marginalized
likelhood, we expect any bias introduced by the importance sampling method to
be negligable.}.
The observed values of the variables; $F_8$, \rhostar and \logg can be thought
of as a single `draw' from an underlying (assumed Gaussian) probability
distribution, with mean equal to the `true' value\footnote{We use `true' to
mean the value that would have been observed, given infinitely high
signal-to-noise.} and standard deviation equal to the observational
uncertainty.
We compute the likelihood of the data given the model, marginalized over the
true values, using importance sampling.
We sample from the posterior PDFs of the true values of the variables,
conditioned on the observed values, and compute the likelihood of each of those
samples.
% These posterior PDFs could be produced by the astronomers who provide the
% catalog.
% If posterior samples are made available, they can be used in this stage of
% the inference.
% In the event that they are not provided however, they can be generated.
% For example, the $log(g)$ values used here are point estimates of the
% posterior PDFs of $log(g)$, produced by \citet{chaplin:2014} using
% {\it Kepler} light curves and stellar models.
We would use the posterior samples generated in previous model fitting process
if they were available, however generating new samples is an acceptable
approximation provided the posteriors are Gaussian (or log-Normal) and the
priors used by the previous fitters were uninformative.
Such an approximation {\it will not be necessary} for those studies using
\rhostar or \logg calculated using the newly-calibrated relations
presented here, as long as the posterior samples are published.
After producing new posterior PDF samples we then add up the individual
log-likelihoods of each sample to compute the total marginalized likelihood
for a star.
The marginalized likelihood of the whole dataset is then computed as the sum
of the log-likelihoods of each star.
The importance sampling method allows us to approximate the integral over the
latent variables.

Figures \ref{fig:rhostar} and \ref{fig:logg} show the data with the best-fit
model.
The faint colored lines show the model where the parameters have been drawn
from their posterior PDFs.
