%% DISCUSSION

We have recalibrated the relation between short timescale brightness
fluctuations in the {\it Kepler} light curves of stars (flicker) with both
stellar density and surface gravity.
This is a simple `fitting a line to data' exercise, however it continues the
discussion of probabilistic modelling that is an active topic within the
fields of exoplanet and stellar astronomy.
We use Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) to constrain the intrinsic
scatter in the relationship between flicker, surface gravity and density.
We also include the effects of the non-negligable two-dimensional observational
uncertainties by marginalizing over latent variables using importance sampling.
Although none of these methods, nor the data used here are new taken alone,
we use the example of flicker to demonstrate the ideas and the importance of
probabilistic, hierarchical inference.
Relationships between astronomical parameters are almost always
non-deterministic; an element of stochasticity effects the physical parameters
of stars so one can never perfectly predict $y$ given an observation of $x$.
We advocate a probabilistic approach in both the `fitting the model to data'
step, {\it and} when using an empirically calibrated model to predict
parameter values.
The fitting stage benefits because if the relationships between parameters are
falsely assumed to be deterministic, they will be skewed by data points with
unrepresentative uncertainties.
The prediction stage benefits from the stochastic treatment both because a
probability distribution is in many ways more representative of an observation
than a point estimate, and because posterior PDF samples can be used in
subsequent studies (provided the prior used during the fitting process is
described).

We provide posterior PDF samples and the code used in this project at
\url{https://github.com/RuthAngus/flicker}.
Whenever a prediction for the surface gravity or density of a star is required,
for a given estimate of flicker, we recommend using these posterior samples
within the calculation of $\rho_{*}$ or $\log(g)$ and its (Monte Carlo)
uncertainty.
These posterior samples will naturally fold-in the covariances between
parameters.
Simple analytical uncertainty propagation is only valid when uncertainties are
Gaussian and uncorrelated which is rarely true and certainly not the case when
the model is a straight line (the slope and intercept are correlated by
definition).
A flicker value with uncertainties (or even better: posterior PDF
samples), input into our model will result in a probability distribution over
stellar densities or surface gravities which reflects both the uncertainties
on the flicker measurement, the uncertainties on the model parameters {\it and}
the intrinsic scatter in the flicker-$\rho_{*}$-$\log(g)$ relations.
