# flicker
HBM with flicker

Flicker.bug contains the model shown below.

![pgm](https://github.com/RuthAngus/flicker/blob/master/pgm.png)

`simpleMCMC.py` - uncertainties on 1d, HBM with density
`MCMClogg.py` - uncertainties on 1d, HBM with logg
`main.py` - uncertainties in 2d, non-HBM with logg
`rho2d.py` - uncertainties in 2d, non-HBM with rho

`plots.py` - creates main flicker plot using mcmc samples

To do:
make rho2d: Uncertainties in 2d, HBM with density
make logg2d: Uncertainties in 2d, HBM with logg

rho2 and main currently running
